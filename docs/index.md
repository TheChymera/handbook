## How to use this documentation

- To start using the archive head over to: [Working with DANDI](./10_using_dandi.md)

- If you want to know more about the DANDI project, its goals and the problems
it tries to solve: check out our [introduction](./01_introduction.md).

- The DANDI archive stores cellular neurophysiology datasets using NWB, BIDS,
and other BRAIN Initiative standards. If you are unfamiliar with such things,
head over to our [FAQ](./98_FAQ.md). You do not need an in depth understanding of
what those things are to use the DANDI archive but some "big picture" conceptual
understanding could save you from a lot of confusion. ðŸ˜‰

- Not sure how the project is organized? Check out the [project structure](./20_project_structure)
