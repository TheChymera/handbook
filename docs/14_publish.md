# Publish Dandiset

You should first create your `Dandiset` and upload the data, to see more check [the Dandiset Upload section](./14_upload.md).

Once the `Dandiset` is created, DANDI will automatically create a `draft` version of the `Dandiset` that could be change as many time as needed. Once you are ready to publish your data and to create a unique version of your `Dandiset` you can click `Publish` button (the right panel of the landing page). Note, that the `Publish` button is only active if all the metadata and asset errors are fixed.

Remember, that if you need to change the `Dandiset` or its metadata in the future, you will need to create another version of your `Dandiset`. The content of the specific published version of the `Dandiset` can not be changed.
