# Publish Dandiset

You should first create your `Dandiset` and upload the data, to see more check [the Dandiset Upload section](./14_upload.md).

Once the `Dandiset` is created, DANDI will automatically create a `draft` version of the `Dandiset` that could be change as many time as needed. Once you are ready to publish your data and to create a unique version of your `Dandiset` you can click `Publish` button (the right panel of the landing page). Note, that the `Publish` button is only active if all the metadata and asset errors are fixed.

It is recommended that you edit your metadata appropriately, **before publishing**, to add different types of information
(e.g., people and funding contributors, protocol information, keywords, related resources in other 
sources such as publications, code repositories, other data).
Remember, that if you need to change the `Dandiset` or its metadata in the future, you will need to create another version of your `Dandiset`. The content of the specific published version of the `Dandiset` can not be changed.
