# Working with DANDI

DANDI provides access to an archive that stores cellular neurophysiology
datasets. We refer to such datasets as `Dandisets`.

1. A `Dandiset` is organized in a structured manner to help users and
software tools interact with it.
1. Each `Dandiset` has a unique persistent identifier that you can use to go directly
to the `Dandiset` (e.g., [https://identifiers.org/DANDI:000004](https://identifiers.org/DANDI:000004)).
You can use this identifier to cite the `Dandiset` in your publications or provide
direct access to a `Dandiset`.

## DANDI components

### The DANDI Web application

The [DANDI Web application](https://dandiarchive.org/) allows you to:

1. Browse `Dandisets`.
1. Search across `Dandisets`.
1. Create an account to register a new `Dandiset` or gain access to
[the Dandihub analysis platform](#the-dandihub-analysis-platform).
1. Add collaborators to your `Dandiset`.
1. Retrieve an `API key` to perform data upload to your `Dandisets`.
1. Publish versions of your `Dandisets`.

### The DANDI Python client

The [DANDI Python client](https://pypi.org/project/dandi/) allows you to:

1. Download `Danidsets` and individual subject folders or files.
1. Organize your data locally before upload.
1. Upload `Dandisets`.

### The Dandihub analysis platform

[Dandihub](https://hub.dandiarchive.org) provides a Jupyter environment to
interact with the DANDI archive. To use the hub, you will need to register an
account using [the DANDI Web application](#the-dandi-web-application). Please
note that `Dandihub` is not intended for significant computation, but provides a
place to introspect `Dandisets` and files.

## Downloading from DANDI

You can download entire `Dandisets` or single files.

### Downloading a file

#### Using the Web application

Each `Dandiset` has a `View Data` option. This provides a folder-like view to
navigate a `Dandiset`. Any file in the `Dandiset` has a download icon next to it.
You can click this icon to download a file to your device where you are browsing
or right click to get the download URL of the file. You can then use this URL
programmatically or in other applications such as the [NWB Explorer](https://nwbexplorer.opensourcebrain.org/)
or in a [Jupyter notebook on Dandihub](https://hub.dandiarchive.org).

#### Using the Python CLI

First install the Python client using `pip install dandi` in a Python 3.7+
environment.


1. Downloading a `Dandiset`, e.g.:
`dandi download https://identifiers.org/DANDI:000004`
1. Downloading data for a specific subject from a dandiset
(names of the subjects could be found on the gui.dandiarchive.org website or by running `dandi ls -r https://identifiers.org/DANDI:000004`), e.g.:
`dandi download https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/dandisets/000004/versions/draft/assets/?path=sub-P10HMH`
1. Downloading a specific file from a dandiset (a link for the specific file could be found on the gui.dandiarchive.org website), e.g.:
`dandi download https://api.dandiarchive.org/api/dandisets/000004/versions/draft/assets/9d9f379d-9fd1-4872-8c49-3891dfb693ab/download/`

## Create an account on DANDI

To create an account on DANDI, you will need to.

1. [Create a Github account](https://github.com/) if you don't have one.
1. Using your Github account [register a DANDI account](https://gui.dandiarchive.org/#/user/register).
1. You will receive an email acknowledging activation of your account within 24
hours. You can now login to DANDI using the Github by clicking on the login
button.

## Uploading a Dandiset

1. Setup
    - If you do not have a DANDI account, please [create an account](#create-an-account-on-dandi)
    - Log in to DANDI and copy your API key. Click on your user initials on the
    top right after logging in.
    - Locally
        - Create a Python environment (not required, but strongly recommended, e.g., [miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands),
         [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
        - Install the DANDI CLI into your Python environment

                pip install -U dandi

        - Store your API key somewhere that the CLI can find it; see ["Storing
          Access Credentials"](#storing-access-credentials) below.

1. Data upload/management workflow
    1. Register a dandiset to generate an identifier. You will be asked to enter
      basic metadata, a name (title) and description (abstract) for your dataset.
      Click `NEW DANDISET` in the Web application (top right corner) after logging in. 
      After you provide name and description, the dataset identifer will be created, 
      we will call this `<dataset_id>`.
    1. NWB format:
        1. Convert your data to NWB 2.1+ in a local folder. Let's call this `<source_folder>`
        This step can be complex depending on your data. Feel free to [reach out to
        us for help](https://github.com/dandi/helpdesk/discussions).
        1. Validate the NWB files by running: `dandi validate <source_folder>`. 
        **If you are having trouble with validation, make sure the conversions were run with the most recent version of `PyNWB` and `MatNWB`.**
        1. Preparing a dataset folder for upload:

                dandi download https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/<dataset_id>/draft
                cd <dataset_id>
                dandi organize <source_folder> -f dry
                dandi organize <source_folder>
                dandi upload

        1. Add metadata on the Web. Click on the `Edit metadata` link by visiting
    your dandiset landing page: `https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/<dataset_id>/draft`
        1. Use the dandiset URL in your preprint directly, or download it using the dandi CLI:
            `dandi download https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/<dataset_id>/draft`
    1. BIDS format:
        1. Please [reach out to Dandi team for help](https://github.com/dandi/helpdesk/discussions).

## Storing Access Credentials

By default, the DANDI CLI looks for an API key in the `DANDI_API_KEY`
environment variable.  If this is not set, the CLI will look up the API
key using the [keyring](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring) library, which
supports numerous backends, including the system keyring, an encrypted keyfile,
and a plaintext (unencrypted) keyfile.

- You can store your API key where the `keyring` library can find it by using
  the `keyring` program: Run `keyring set dandi-api-dandi key` and enter the
  API key when asked for the password for `key` in `dandi-api-dandi`.

- You can set the backend the `keyring` library uses either by setting the
  `PYTHON_KEYRING_BACKEND` environment variable or by filling in [the `keyring`
  library's configuration file](https://github.com/jaraco/keyring#configuring).
  IDs for the available backends can be listed by running `keyring --list`.  If
  no backend is specified in this way, the library will use the available
  backend with the highest priority.

If the API key isn't stored in either the `DANDI_API_KEY` environment variable
or in the keyring, the CLI will prompt you to enter the API key, and then it
will store it in the keyring.  This may cause you to be prompted further; you
may be asked to enter a password to encrypt/decrypt the keyring, or you may be
asked by your OS to confirm whether to give the DANDI CLI access to the
keyring.

- If the DANDI CLI encounters an error while attempting to fetch the API key
  from the default keyring backend, it will fall back to using an encrypted
  keyfile (the `keyrings.alt.file.EncryptedKeyring` backend).  If the keyfile
  does not already exist, the CLI will ask you for confirmation; if you answer
  "yes," the `keyring` configuration file (if does not already exist; see
  above) will be configured to use `EncryptedKeyring` as the default backend.
  If you answer "no," the CLI will exit with an error, and you must store the
  API key somewhere accessible to the CLI on your own.
